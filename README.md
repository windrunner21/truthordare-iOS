## Implementation
Implemented using native iOS development. 

### Architecture
Architecture used for the project is a 4 layered architecture. Layers are: 

- Business Logic Layer 
- UI Layer
- Network Layer
- Storage Layer

SOLID principles were used.
Patterns like Delegate Pattern were used to keep code simple and readable.

### In-App Purchases
In-App Purchases: Renewable Subscription named TruthAI+ was implemented in order to grant eligible users access to AI generated content. 
Therefore, custom paywall was implemented inside the application to let users access full features of the application but AI content without the eligible subscription. 
And let paid users access AI generated content. Restore purhases option was implemented as well.

### Storage
CoreData was used in order to store user's custom truths and dares. Encrypted NSUserDefaults were used in order to store user's application settings.

### Network
Network Layer was implemented using core URLSession and Tasks. AI generated content is fetched from trained ChatGPT model.

### Design
Storyboard and Programmable design was used. Storyboards let you imagine the design easier, as they were used in simple screens.
UIKit was used as a UI framework. Custom UI classes were built for reusability and maintanability. Designed by Imran Hajiyev. Prototyped in Figma.
